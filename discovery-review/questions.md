# **Things to ask in a discovery review**

n.b. All these questions are suggestions only to prompt the panel. Actual questions will differ to be relevant to the discovery, but the general areas should be similar to the below.

## Goals &amp; Scope (Design)

What was the goal of your discovery?

What was the scope? Did it change over the course of discovery?

What rabbit holes did you fall into, or avoid falling into?

What will be the scope of your Alpha? What problem will it try to solve?

What will not be in scope?


## Findings (UR)

Who are your users, what are they trying to achieve and how do they do it?

How many people are there in this user group? (i.e What&#39;s the addressable market?)

What are the different services involved in this? Who runs them?

What are the different channels used and how does the journey differ across them? (e.g Paper, digital, phone, f2f, etc.)

What key pain points did you discover in your research? (e.g Duplication of effort) What do you know about the impact of these pain points on users, the organisation and to government?

What support channels are available to users when things go wrong?

What are the key constraints you will need to work with? (Technical, policy, contracts, etc.) How much of these are &#39;hard&#39; constraints and how much might you be able to change them?

## Research methodology (UR)

Talk us through the research approach taken for this discovery â€“ how did you define the high level research questions and methodology?

What were your assumptions at the start of your Discovery? How did you test them?

What kind of qualitative research have you done? (Exploratory interviews, usability testing, etc.)

What kind of quantitative research have you done? (Analytics data, surveys, etc.)

How have you been storing research data? I.e. securely? GDPR compliance?

To what extent has your research reflected the users&#39; demographics/characteristics? How have you made sure your research does not discriminate against anybody?

What constraints was the research operating under? Where there any barriers to the work?

In hindsight would you have approached the discovery any differently?

What surprised you the most?

## Tech findings (Tech)

Does the current process use appropriate/modern technology?

Which of the pain points are being caused by technical issues? (e.g Slow processing time, service being unavailable, etc.)

Have you discovered any threats to security or privacy? (e.g Fraud risk, hacking, etc.)

Is the current process GDPR compliant?

Is the source code for any current services&#39; open?

Do you foresee any issues using common government components and patterns?

## Team &amp; Plans for Alpha (Lead)

Is the problem valuable to solve? How much is it currently costing us?

Is now the right time to solve the problem? Why? How urgent is it?

Who is responsible for solving the problem? (Homes England, MHCLG, Other dept, Non-gov, etc.)

How have you been working in the open and/or sharing your findings with the rest of government?

How have you involved policy and operations colleagues? (e.g Including them on the discovery team, show &amp; tells to wider colleagues)

What has your team been for Discovery?

What will the approach be from moving from discovery to alpha? I.e. moving from problems to potential solutions, more questions, something useable for the next stage?

What are the outcomes of your discovery and what do you think should happen next? I.e. one or more alphas? More discoveries? Why?

What&#39;s your team going to be for Alpha?

How long do you feel Alpha should last?

How will you employ agile ways of working in Alpha?

Do you have any governance concerns that will stop you working in the right way?

Is there anything else you think will be a major concern for this project going forward or stop you from solving the problem?
